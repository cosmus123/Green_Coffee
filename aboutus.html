        <h3>OUR WORK AT HOME AND ABROAD</h3>
        <article>
            For over two decades our mission has been clear: To use high quality specialty coffee as a vehicle for progressive change throughout the coffeelands of Asia, Africa and the Americas. We do this through <strong>activism, ecological responsibility</strong>            and innovative
            <strong>direct development</strong> programs with our <strong>cooperative partners.</strong>

        <h3>All Organic, Fair Trade and Kosher - Respect for the Quality of Life</h3>
        <section class="process">
            <article>
                All of our fine whole bean specialty coffees are certified <strong>organic, fair trade, and kosher</strong>, and are roasted in small batches at our beanery in Orange, MA. We know that the planting, care, harvesting and processing of the
                beans is done in conformity with international standards for the health of the farmer and their environment, as well as the high quality of the bean. The vast use of pesticides in coffee production has serious impact on the ecology of
                the coffee-growing world and the health of farm communities. Our commitment to only purchase shade grown coffees supports healthy environments for coffee growers and protects critical migratory bird habitat. It is important to us that
                the quality of our coffees includes respect for the quality of life of our southern partners in the coffee world. And that respect translates into superb tasting coffee for your pleasure.

            <h3>Green Beans Represents an Integrated, Progressive Trade System.</h3>
            <article>
                Each player in our cycle of production and distribution, from the farmer to the consumer, participates in socially just and environmentally responsible trade. We hope that all other coffee companies will follow our lead. We only purchase beans from small
                farmer cooperatives, largely made up of indigenous peoples working hard to maintain their culture and lifestyles
